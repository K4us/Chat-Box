          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home,
            they act like they haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for
            different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's best friend... or the wrong
            man's worst enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give
            me Raoul.</p>

          <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
            You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
            We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected,
            you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your

          <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
            Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for
            he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
            vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
            is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
